# Gaussian-Mixture-Model-from-scratch
Gaussian Mixture Model from scratch using E-step and M-Step

Assuming that Σi = σi2I, µ1; µ2; µ3 are computed and the standard deviations σ1; σ2; σ3. For this step GaussianMixture model from sklearn has been used with random initialization , and a default convergence threshold/tolerance of 0.001)

Further, removing any sklearn function that performs the EM algorithm,  EM algorithm from scratch has been developed to estimate the means µ1; µ2; µ3 and the component probabilities π1; π2; π3.
